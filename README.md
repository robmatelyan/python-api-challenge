Penn Data Analysis Bootcamp Assignment 6
</br>
</br>
In this assignment, I created a script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator using the OpenWeatherMap API.
</br>
Various scatter plots were generated by plotting weather details such as temperature or humidity percentage against the ciies' latitudes.
</br>
In part II of this assignment, the Google Places API was used to generate a heatmap based on humidity for the cities generated in part I. Once the heatmap was generated, nearby hotels were plotted.
